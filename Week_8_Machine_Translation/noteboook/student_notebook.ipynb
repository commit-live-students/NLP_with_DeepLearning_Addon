    "### Problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are working on the `English-Spanish dataset` dataset. The dataset can be found at http://www.manythings.org/anki/. The dataset contains translations of Spanish words to English words. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the given dataset we want to predict the correct `Spanish` translation of the `English` words.\n",

    "### About the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A zipped file containing following items is given:\n",
    "\n",
    "- train.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "The data file `train.txt` contains translation of  `123376` Spanish words into its English counterpart. The dataset is tab delimited.\n",
    "\n",
    "- test.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "The datafile `test.txt` contains the `246` English words whose correct Spanish translation has to be predicted. The dataset is tab delimited.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "After training of the model on `train.txt` data, learner has to predict the target feature of the `test.txt` data using the trained model. The learner has to then submit a csv file with the predicted feature.\n",
