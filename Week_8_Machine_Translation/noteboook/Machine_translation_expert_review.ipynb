    "# Chapter 1: Machine Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine translation (MT) is automated translation. It is the process by which computer software is used to translate a text from one natural language (such as English) to another (such as Spanish). \n",
    "\n",
    "Until very recently, if you wanted to know the Chinese translation of an English sentence, you had to hire a linguist who would both know English and Chinese language and would then translate the english text into chinese. Problem solved. But what if you wanted to translate the same piece of text into 5 different languages ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent times, MT has become one of the hottest areas of research given the success it is getting using deep learning. We would have all used Google Translate at some point or the other. Researchers are devising new techniques which are getting them higher accuracy in translating from one language to another. Years of R&D in deep neural networks have resulted in advances in the field of Machine Translation using which we could translate a given piece of text to any language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be the main focus of this tutrial where different aspects of Machine translation will be presented on along with hands on tutorial to implement it yourself. So let's get right on to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Translation(MT) has been an active area of studies right since the very beginnning of the computing age. Over the years it has evolved to what it is today. Some methods included pure semantic translation of the sentence / text based on some linguistic rules like replacing the words of the source language by the words of the target language. While, with the advent of latest search algorithms and big data, the process then shifted to Statistical based approaches. In the new era, with advances in Artificial Intelligence, MT has achived new heights and ever greater accuracy. Lets take a look at each of these processes in a bit more detail to better understand the journey of machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   __1: Rule Based MT__: Rule based approach relies on countless built-in algorithms and sophisticated linguistic rules and millions of bi-lingual dictionaries of each language pair. The text would then be parsed and a transitional representation of the text would then be created, from which the final target text is generated. The translations are built on top of gigantic dictionaries having words from source and the target language thereby exponentially increasing the development cost and time. For example, let's say that we have to translate the following English text to German.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   __Source Language__ :English:  A girl eats an apple.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   __Target Language__: German\n",
    "   \n",
    "   According to Rule based MT, we need following to successfully translate the English text to German:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. A dictionary set, mapping each word in the English language to its German counterpart.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. Rules to represent English grammar\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3. Rules to represent German grammar.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   4. Rules relating English grammar to German grammar.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   So using the above rules, we can attempt to translate the text to German in following stages:-\n",
    "   \n",
    "   __Stage 1__:\n",
    "      Get POS(Parts of speech) information.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      `a` article, `girl` noun, `eats` verb, `an` article, `apple` noun\n",
    "      \n",
    "   __Stage 2__:\n",
    "       \n",
    "      Then translate into German text by dictionary lookup and rules of grammar\n",
    "      \n",
    "      `a` = `ein`\n",
    "      \n",
    "      `girl` = `Madchen`\n",
    "      \n",
    "      `eat` = `essen`\n",
    "      \n",
    "      `apple` = `Apfel`\n",
    "      \n",
    "      So the translation would look something like :\n",
    "      \n",
    "      `A girl eats an apple` => `Ein Madchen isst einen Apfel`\n",
    "    \n",
    "   __2: Statistical MT__: Statistical MT tries to generate translations using statistical methods bases on bilingual text corpora. A document is converted according to probablity distribution $p(e|f)$ that a string $e$ in the target language, for example English is the translation of a string $f$ in the source language (for example, French). \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Typically in Statistical MT models, sentences are translated at once. A bilingual text corpus is trained and translated into probablity functions, like Bayes Theorem, where the translation model depicts a probablity function which estimates the probablity of a source string being a translation of the target string(from the dictionary).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   __Limitations__:\n",
    "   * The accuracy of this approach is directly proportional to the availability of the corpus of the language pair. The constraint here is the limited availability of such corpora for many language pairs thus limiting major success using the Statistical method.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Corpus training and creation can be really costly\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Some errors can be hard to predict and fix.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   __Other statistical based approaches:__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   __2.1: Word based MT__: In word based MT, the fundamental unit of translation is a word. So each word of the source language is mapped on to one or more word of the target language. And then, a probablity function determines the best word(from the target language) to repressent the word from the source lang. However, the number of words in the translatd sentence can differ since a word in source language may tranlate to one or more words in the target language. To have a standard statistical measurement for this, a measure of ration of lengths of sequences of translated words called __fertility__ was introduced. It basically tells how many target language words, a source language word produces. It was assumed from the principles of Information theory that each of these words would cover the same concept. In practise however, this was not really true. For example, the English word corner can be translated in Spanish by either rincÃ³n or esquina, depending on whether it is to mean its internal or external angle.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Let us try and understand this with a more concrete example. In what follows we will try to translate a German text into English.\n",
    "   Haus (German) -> house, building, home, household, shell(The house of a snail is shell)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Now we see here that 1 german word has multiple english word translation based on the context of usage etc. Using statistical MT based approach, we will find out the word with the hightst probablity in the corpus(as shown in the figure below)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   <img src=\"../images/wordbasedmt.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when we look at the maximum likelihood score of the above words,\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/probablity_wordmt.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So we choose \"house\" as the probable translation to the word \"Haus\". Similarly we translate all the other words in source text (German) to target text (English):-\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/wt.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "   __2.2: Phrase Based MT__: Phrase based models adopt a similar way of translation as Word based MT, the difference being, in Word based MT, the atomic unit is a word, whereas in Phrase based MT, the atomic unit is a phrase.\n",
    "Source text is split into phrases and then each phrase is then translated into the target language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try and understand this with an example. Let us consider the following source text(German):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/phrasemt1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the figure above, the foreign text is segmented into phrases. Now similar to Word based translation, maximum likelihood score for the phrases will be calculated from the corpus and each of the probable phrases in the target language (English) will be assigned a score. The phrase with the best score would then be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the phrase translation of the word \"natuerlich\", the probablity scores could be something like :\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/phrasemt2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly the scores for each of the phrases would be calculated and then the translation to the target language would be the output as shown in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/phrasemt3.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "   __3: Neural Machine Translation__: Neural MT takes advantage of the advances in deep learning in the world today and attempts to mitigate the shortcomings of other machine translation approaches that we studied earlier. It has been observed that it is able to produce better results with greator accuracy and with requirement of less data. Infact, many popular neural based machine translation do not need any inputs regarding grammar, rules of the language etc(unlike rule based / statistical machine translation).\n",
    "   \n",
    "Many of the popular neural MT approaches use a framework called Encoder-Decoder framework, in which the source language is encoded into an intermediatory machine generated language and is then decoded by another Decoder layer. This approach has proved to be very efficient in generating translations with very high accuracy and is currently the industry adopted approach for machine translation. We will be studying this is greator detail in the next few chapters."

    "## 2.1 Seq2Seq Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Seq2Seq models use neural networks to translate a piece of text from a source language to a machine language. Introduced by Google, it has proved itself for a variety of applications, namely, machine translation, image captioning, conversation models, text summarization etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the name sugests, it injests words in sequence and translates them. The beauty of seq2seq is that it not only considers the word, but it also considers the neighbouring words to capture better semantics. It uses RNN to learn and then translate an unseen piece of text from one language to another. More often than not, some specialized RNNs like LSTM or GRU is used since the vanilla RNN suffers from the problem of vanishing gradients. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seq2Seq models use a special arrangements of neural networks, viz, __Encoder Decoder__ networks to translate. The Encoder takes in the source text and outputs an intermediate vector which represents the input sequence. The decoder then reads the intermediate vector output of the encoder and then translates it into the target language. The following figure gives a pictorial representation of seq2seq model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/encodec_overview.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A stack of several recurrent units (LSTM or GRU cells for better performance) where each accepts a single element of the input sequence, collects information for that element and propagates it forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The input sequence is a collection of all words from the question. Each word is represented as x_i where i is the order of that word. The words are then encoded into dense vectors to represt the input text. This vector aims to encapsulate the information for all input elements in order to help the decoder make accurate predictions.It acts as the initial hidden state of the decoder part of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A stack of several recurrent units where each predicts an output y_t at a time step t.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each recurrent unit accepts a hidden state from the previous unit(Encoder unit) and produces and output as well as its own hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The output sequence is a collection of all words from the answer. Each word is represented as y_i where i is the order of that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of this model lies in the fact that it can map sequences of different lengths to each other. As you can see the inputs and outputs are not correlated and their lengths can differ. This opens a whole new range of problems which can now be solved using such architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Encoder - Decoder model not only gets better accuracy, but is also much scalable than any of the traditional machine translation methods know thus far. Infact, seq2seq is so popular and effective that any modern day machine translation happens via this. Google translate is one of the most popular platforms relying on seq2seq for translating text in different languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses in Industry\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "### Seq2Seq in action\n",
    "\n",
    "Having seen how seq2seq works at a very high level, let us try and understand how do we actually translate a text from a source language to a target language. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our study let us consider the following sentence in Spanish :\n",
    "\n",
    "__Patrick visitarÃ¡ la India en septiembre.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The task at hand is to translate this sentence into English. However we do have some problems to solve first.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To translate the text correctly into the target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To check if the translated text is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To select the best available translation(after 1 & 2) of the target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point 1 is pretty clear in itself. However, 2 brings with itself additional problems,i.e, how do we verify if the translated text is correct. Point 3 futher states that, assuming if the translation(s) are correct, which one do we select. How do we determine the accuracy of the translation. Forexample, let us look at the following translations of the above text:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Patrick will visit India in September.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Patrick is going to visit India in September.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In September, Patrick will be  visiting India.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In September, Patrick is welcome in India.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translations from 1-3 are more or less correct and they kind of convey the meaning of the source language. However, translation number 1 is the best out of all the 4 because it conveys the meaning of the source text precisely and concisely and also is grammatically correct. However, translation 4 goes awfully wrong. We will see how tackle / solve the above problems one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try and define the objective now. The objective of a machine translation model is to translate a given piece of text in one language to its best possible match in the target language. Or in other words, find a piece of text in the target language whose probablity of being a correct translation of the piece of text in the source language is the highest. Mathematically, we can say that we have to find translation(text in target language) which has the highest conditional probablity of being the correct translation given the source text. In another words we need to find the value of $Y_i$ which maximizes $P(Y|X)$ ,where $Y$ is a set of all the probable candidates for the correct translation and $X$ is the source text. To find the words from the target dictionary, we use a specialized algorithm called Beam Search. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Beam Search__\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to translate successfully, we need to find the words to begin with. Beam search is a specially designed algorithm to help us with that. It will find the most probable word(s) from the dictionary of the target language that will be used in the translated text. Let's take a look at the image below:-\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/beamsearch_step1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the actions performed by the beam search algorithm to find out the words from the target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 1__:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given dictionary of the target language & the beam width (explained in the figure), find out the probablity of the all the words from the dictionary given the source text. \n",
    "\n",
    "    $P(Y_i|X)$ , where $Y_i$ are the words from the dictionary and $X$ is the source text to be translated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    So essentially the beam search algorithm would take all the words in the dictionary of the target language and run it through a softmax layer over an encoder-decoder network, essentially calculating conditinal probability of all the words in the dictionary so as to choose the best first word.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"../images/beamsearch2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select top n = beam width words which have the highest conditional probablity. In this case let us say the top three words that the beam search algorithm picks up is \"patrick\", \"in\", \"september\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 2__:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After getting the most probable first words for the translation, the beam search algorithms needs to find the next words. To do that,\n",
    "    * It keeps the first words in memory(number of words equal to the max beam length) calculates the probablity of the second word given the first word and the input sentence. An intuition can be developed from the image below:-\n",
    "    <img src=\"../images/beamsearch_s20.png\"/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/beamsearch_step2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the image above, the algorithm now tries to find out the second word keeping the first set of words fixed (from step 1). Mathematically, in this step we are trying to maximize the probablity of two words given the input sentence.\n",
    "$P(Y_1,Y_2|X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "By the rules of conditional probablity, this can also be written as:-\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(Y_1,Y_2|X)=P(Y_1|X)*P(Y_2|X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the above operation is carried out on all the words of the dictionary one by one, we get the pair of words with the highest probablity as probable candidates for the translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation can also be extented to n terms, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(Y_1...Y_n|X)=P(Y_1|X)*P(Y_2|X)...P(Y_n|X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above steps are repeated until all the probable words for the translation are found out by the algorithm. So the entire process when combined might look something like this:-\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/machine_translation.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Translation Evaluation: Bleu Score (Bilingual evaluation understudy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, once we have a proper translation, how do we verify the results? To evaluate a MT model, the standard way is to calculate the Blue score. However, The standard way to calculate the accuracy of a ML model is by calculating __Precision__. Let's see why calculating Precision will not work in our example. So let's take our translation example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Spanish : Patrick visitarÃ¡ la India en septiembre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some human verified references :\n",

    "1. Patrick will visit India in September.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Patrick is going to visit India in September\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's take a look at what a machine translated output could look like in extreme cases :-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Patrick will visit India in September.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. visit visit visit visit visit visit\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we were to calculate the Precision of the above outputs, it would give some unexpected results. Like, let's calculate the precision of machine translated output #2 \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that precision is number of correct predections (In this case a prediction is correct is the word is present in the human reference ) divided by total correct predictions. So in our reference num 1 , we see there are 6 words, and from the machine translated output, we see that all the 6 words (visit) is present in the human reference. So this essentially gives us a precision of 1 for a poorly translated output.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is for this problem, a new measure for calculating the effectiveness of machine translation was invented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blue score is calculated in the following way:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. n-Grams are considered for calculating the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Number of occurance of n-Grams(in the above example, unigrams ) is capped to the maximum number of occurance of the n-Grams in any of the references.\n",
    "\n",

We will learn how to use translate sentence from a source language to another language by building a Seq2Seq model using Keras, a popular python deep learning API. \n",

    "# Chapter 3: Attention Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last chapter, we learnt about Machine Translation and how to do it in Python. In this chapter, we will learn another very important concept called Attention Mechanism. Attention mechanisms have gained much popularity in recent times because of using them has increased the accuracy of the Encoder-Decoder RNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Introduction of Attention Model\n",
    "\n",
    "__What is Attention Model?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, attention model was majorly proposed as a solution to the traditional Encoder-Decoder model in machine translation. Recall that the Encoder-Decoder model used to encode a fixed length vector injesting all the input data at once to feed it to the Decoder which would then decode all the input (output of the decoder) at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Why Attention Models?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Now compare it to a typical problem of machine translation. Imagine if you or any human were to translate the a given input sentence to a target output language. If you were reading the complete sentence at once and translating it to the target language, you would probably do good for short sentences, like < 10 words, but would you be efficient if the input sentences were long ? No, right. Ironically the same behaviour was observed when traditional machine translation models were used in translation. It was found that the accuracy of the model was okay till about a certain length of the input sentence. However, when the length of the input sentence increased, the accuracy of the MT models started going down.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be explained from the following figure:-\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/attention_1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Advantages__\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention models address this exact problem faced in traditional MT models. Let's try to understand this with the human translating sentence example we saw earlier. Now typically when a human gets a long input sentence, when he/she would sub-consciously do is break the sentence into parts, like of 4-5 words, read them and translate it into target language, and then move on to the next chunk of sentence. The way these small chunks are decided completely depends on person to person, but the idea is that a large sentence is then broken down into smaller sentence and then each of the smaller sentence is translated. It was observed that using this approach, the MT accuracy was high, even for sentences with large number of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/attention_2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 How does it work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section let's try to understand how does attention model work. How is it able to maintain accuracy of the prediction over a large input sentence. To do that lets take a look at the following figure, which extends to our last learnt concept of encoder-decoder networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/attention_3.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the Attention Model differs from typical Encoder Decoder model is that instead of the decoder network directly decoding the output of the Encoder network, it is not passed on a Context vector $C$ which is a combination of output of the Encoder network $\\alpha$ and an attention parameter $A$. The Context vector $C$ is then passed on to the decoder network to get the final output. Let's try to understand this process in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As you can see in the figure above, attention parameter is calculated for each of the input sequences. We denote this attention parameter using $\\alpha$. $\\alpha_i$ denotes the amount of attention that you need to pay to its corresponding input vector $x_i$. To get an intuition, think of it as a complex function which determines the weight of the input sequence. \n",
    "The way you calculate $\\alpha_i$ is to train a small neural network which basically takes in two parameters:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The output of the encoder network of a particular input sequence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. The hidden state of the encoder network (which we were not considering at all in the traditional Encoder- Decoder) network.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The following figure demonstrates the above concept. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"../images/attentionparam.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once you have the attention parameter $\\alpha$, we now compute a Context vector which is nothing but a weighted sum of the product of:\n",
    "    1. Output of the encoder netework.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Attention parameter.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $C=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\alpha_i*A_i$\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The Context vector $C$ is then fed into the deocder network to predict the output. To predict the output, we use a feed forward neural network, which takes in the Context Vectors (from step 2 ) as the parameters and then predicts the decoded output of the network. The following figures attempts to give an intuition on the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"../images/decoder_attention.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice here that the input to the decoder is now an attention parameter which indicates how much of attention to give to each of the words in the input sequence and the output of the encoder. This way the decoder network is able to decode the input sequence in batches (since the attention parameter tends to zero for far off words. Which makes sense also since usuallly the far off words do not carry the context or any relation with the current word in a language.)\n",
