    "\n",
    "As the name sugests, it injests words in sequence and translates them. The beauty of seq2seq is that it not only considers the word, but it also considers the neighbouring words to capture better semantics. It uses RNN to learn and then translate an unseen piece of text from one language to another. More often than not, some specialized RNNs like LSTM or GRU is used since the vanilla RNN suffers from the problem of vanishing gradients. \n",

    "Seq2Seq models use a special arrangements of neural networks, viz, __Encoder Decoder__ networks to translate. The Encoder takes in the source text and outputs an intermediate vector which represents the input sequence.

    "2. The input sequence is a collection of all words from the question. Each word is represented as x_i where i is the order of that word. The words are then encoded into dense vectors to represt the input text.

    "\n",
    "2. To check if the translated text is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To select the best available translation(after 1 & 2) of the target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point 1 is pretty clear in itself. However, 2 brings with itself additional problems,i.e, how do we verify if the translated text is correct. Point 3 futher states that, assuming if the translation(s) are correct, which one do we select. How do we determine the accuracy of the translation. Forexample, let us look at the following translations of the above text:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Patrick will visit India in September.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Patrick is going to visit India in September.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "4. In September, Patrick is welcome in India.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translations from 1-3 are more or less correct and they kind of convey the meaning of the source language. However, translation number 1 is the best out of all the 4 because it conveys the meaning of the source text precisely and concisely and also is grammatically correct. However, translation 4 goes awfully wrong. We will see how tackle / solve the above problems one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try and define the objective now. The objective of a machine translation model is to translate a given piece of text in one language to its best possible match in the target language. Or in other words, find a piece of text in the target language whose probablity of being a correct translation of the piece of text in the source language is the highest. Mathematically, we can say that we have to find translation(text in target language) which has the highest conditional probablity of being the correct translation given the source text. In another words we need to find the value of $Y_i$ which maximizes $P(Y|X)$ ,where $Y$ is a set of all the probable candidates for the correct translation and $X$ is the source text. To find the words from the target dictionary, we use a specialized algorithm called Beam Search. \n",

    "\n",
    "    $P(Y_i|X)$ , where $Y_i$ are the words from the dictionary and $X$ is the source text to be translated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    So essentially the beam search algorithm would take all the words in the dictionary of the target language and run it through a softmax layer over an encoder-decoder network, essentially calculating conditinal probability of all the words in the dictionary so as to choose the best first word.\n",

    "    <img src=\"../images/beamsearch2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select top n = beam width words which have the highest conditional probablity. In this case let us say the top three words that the beam search algorithm picks up is \"patrick\", \"in\", \"september\".\n",

    "$P(Y_1,Y_2|X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "By the rules of conditional probablity, this can also be written as:-\n",
